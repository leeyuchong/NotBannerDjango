Description: Bootstrap 4 forms for Django
        ============================
        
        Bootstrap 4 integration for django using `widget templates`_ that were
        introduced in Django 1.11.
        
        Motivation
        ----------
        
        This library is meant to be a drop-in replacement for
        `django-bootstrap4`_. See below for a list of differences. I really like
        that library, but it is hard to customize some things because everything
        is done in python functions. By using widget templates, I hope this
        library is more flexible.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install with pip::
        
           pip install django-bs4
        
        After that you have to add it to ``INSTALLED_APPS``. You also need to
        make sure that the correct ``FORM_RENDERER`` is selected and
        ``django.forms`` is in ``INSTALLED_APPS`` (after ``django-bs4``). This
        is required so that widget templates can be overwritten::
        
           INSTALLED_APPS = [
               …
               'django-bs4',
               …
               'django.forms',
               …
           ]
        
           FORM_RENDERER = 'django.forms.renderers.TemplatesSetting'
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The following template tags are included in the ``bootstrap4`` library:
        
        -  ``bootstrap_field {boundfield}`` - Render a single field.
        -  ``bootstrap_form {form}`` - Render errors and all fields for a form.
           The ``<form>`` element itself is not included.
        -  ``bootstrap_messages`` - Render messages from
           ``django.contrib.messages``.
        -  ``bootstrap_pagination {page}`` - Render pagination. A ``<nav>``
           element is not included.
        
        Please refer to the source code for additional parameters.
        
        Differences to django-bootstrap4
        --------------------------------
        
        -  Uses widget templates instead of custom renderers. IMHO this
           makes the code much easier to read and customize. A big downside is
           that I had to monkey-patch ``BoundField.as_widget()`` to include some
           information that would otherwise not be available in the widget
           templates.
        -  Concentrates on forms fields and does therefore not include some
           others features.
        -  Uses ``small.text-danger`` instead of ``.invalid-feedback`` as it
           does not depend on DOM location. (see also `twbs/bootstrap#29439`_)
        -  Does not use ``.is-valid`` because I find it confusing with
           server-side rendering.
        -  Does not include dismiss-buttons for alerts to avoid depending on
           JavaScript.
        -  Does not include field errors at the top of forms as they are already
           displayed on the fields themselves.
        -  Improved ARIA support.
        -  You will have to load bootstrap yourself.
        -  No configuration.
